Trump Card is an iOS app I developed for my Mobile App Dev class. In the game the player takes the role of Donald J. Trump as the Presidential nominee. The setting is a press conference where players are asked questions by the press and each question has two choices, one choice is generally a response a calmer, and subdued Donald Trump would give while the second choice is an off-the-cuff answer an agitated Trump would say. Each choice is actually a direct quote or a paraphrased version of an actual Trump quote. There is also a list with all the Trump quotes used in the game and they are all referenced and some have audio clips attached that play when a card swipe is made.

### Goal

The goal of the game is to end the press conference with enough favorability with voters to gain their vote on election day. Voters are divided into five blocs: African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latinos, White college educated, and White non-college educated voters. Each response by Trump has an individual effect on these voting groups and this affects the players favorability. The players favorability is measured by voting groups based on their makeup of the electorate. If by the end of the press conference there favorability is above 50% then the player wins otherwise they lose.

## Game Mechanics

Trump Card is a simple game where the player acts as then Presidential candidate Donald Trump and is asked numerous questions during a press conference. The player has the opportunity to swipe left or right to give an answer. The player's goal is then to have a high enough favorability rating to win the presidency. On every swipe head icons representing the different demographic groups will appear showing their reaction to the answer. If the group found the answer damaging.
